# cinema-room-rest-services

Project is in the master branch. 

#Project description
e your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy
projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? Having a booth is 
old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! 
Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats,sell
and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!
